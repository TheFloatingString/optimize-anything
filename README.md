# Optimize Anything as a Service

Assuming that any statement can be transformed into an optimization problem, this project uses [OpenAI Swarm](https://github.com/openai/swarm)'s agent framework to convert user statements into optimization problems with numerical results. 

```
pip install git+https://github.com/openai/swarm.git
python demo.py
```

Built at the AI Agents Hackathon hosted by Harvard St. Commons.
